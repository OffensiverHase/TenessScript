# TenessScript

This project is the more serious version of [Rahanji](https://github.com/OffensiverHase/releases/) 

It is currently a work in progress small interpretet programming language. I plan on also writing a compiler for this language, but for now this won't be posiible.
For a small tutorial take a look at the [rahanji grammar](https://github.com/OffensiverHase/releases/blob/main/rahanji.md). The syntax of TenessScript has quite some small changes, for example real keywords like if, while and fun. Anyway I think if you are willing to, you will learn this language really quick.
